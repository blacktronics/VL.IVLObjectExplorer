# VL.IVLObjectExplorer
Provides a Skia layer which lists all properties of a record  using ImGui

Do not look at the code for your own sanity, poorly adapted my Serializer to do this.

**Does not allow modifying data in the object (yet)**, it is very hastily hacked together and spiders live inside some of the crawlers.

I only needed it to show me stuff for now, so that is what it does.
